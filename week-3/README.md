#Week 3 - Problem Set 3
Week 3 taught me a lot about handling errors and using try and except to write code which would otherwise stop the running of the program.
I now know how to bypass different errors in a way, using try and except

I learnt how to write programs that exits gracefully when it comes across an error as opposed to showing the cryptic error message to the user
While I was doing fuel.py I realised that the code I wrote a while back worked but doesn't now because a test case was added to handle a case where the numbers of the fraction where negative.


##Realisation
I think I've just experienced fuzz testing in full effect with check50, something that I learnt in the Git University course, where random inputs are sent to the program in order to get an unexpected problem.
